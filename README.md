# modal-analysis
Modal Analysis using FEM with Python. Each program finds the frequencies and vibration shapes for a beam, air in an enclosed cavity and water sloshing. 

- poutre.py solves vibration modes of a beam (poutre = beam)
- cavite.py solves vibration modes of air in an enclosed cavity (cavit√© = cavity)
- ballottement_EF.py solves the water sloshing vibration modes in an enclosed cavity filled with air and water (ballottement = sloshing)

This code was written for a final graduation project. The final report can be accessed through the following link:
